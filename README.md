# Tic Tac Toe

> This project consists of building a Tic Tac Toe game with JavaScript to render it in a web browser. This project follows
> the lessons about Factory Functions and The Module Pattern. So the main goal is to put in practice those concepts along
> with the main concepts of OOP. Particularly classes, objects, and how to access their methods and attributes.

names respectively. Fill the input and confirm the name by clicking `accept`.
