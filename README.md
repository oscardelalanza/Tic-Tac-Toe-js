# Tic Tac Toe

> This is a project from Microverse
> In this project, the student builds a Tic Tac Toe game (Again) but this time it‚Äôll be rendered in the browser. 
> No backend. This project follows the lesson about Factory Functions and The Module Pattern so the main goal is to put 
> into practice those concepts along with the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Particularly, classes/objects 
> and how to access their methods and attributes.
